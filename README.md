## Mimic CXR DSCM
Deep Structural Causam Model (DSCM) [1] implementation and training code for the Mimic CXR dataset of chest x-rays as well as counterfactual generation code.

## Datasets
- dscmchest/mimic.py - implementation of the Mimic CXR dataset [2]

## DSCM implementation and training
- dscmchest/pgm_chest.py - normalising flow mechanisms implementation and training
- dscmchest/vae_chest.py - vae implementation
- dscmchest/train_setup.py - initialisation of all datasets and dataloader necessary for training the DSCM.
- dscmchest/hps.py - hyperparameters

## Generation of counterfactuals
- dscmchest/generate_counterfactuals.py - counterfactual generation functions for Mimic CXR
